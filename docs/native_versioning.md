# Native versioning

As of version 1.1 SQLAlchemy-Continuum supports native versioning for PostgreSQL dialect.
Native versioning creates SQL triggers for all versioned models. These triggers keep track of changes made to versioned models. Compared to object based versioning, native versioning has

* Much faster than regular object based versioning
* Minimal memory footprint when used alongside `create_tables=False` and `create_models=False` configuration options.
* More cumbersome database migrations, since triggers need to be updated also.

## Usage

For enabling native versioning you need to set `native_versioning` configuration option as `True`.

```python
make_versioned(options={'native_versioning': True})
```

## Schema migrations

When making schema migrations (for example adding new columns to version tables) you need to remember to call sync_trigger in order to keep the version trigger up-to-date. As of version 1.4.0, `sync_trigger` takes a session as its first argument, so obtain a session in the migration.

```python
from sqlalchemy_continuum.dialects.postgresql import sync_trigger


sync_trigger(session, 'article_version')
```

If you don't use `PropertyModTrackerPlugin`, then you have to disable it:

```python
sync_trigger(session, 'article_version', use_property_mod_tracking=False)
```
